# example-google


this is the clone from my repo and this will be my first commit before 
commiting you should get a pull to update all the commits that were merged to 
the original repo in this case the original repo is asm-r(in your case google)
and my repo is ausamriyaz since i will push it without committing this time since there 
are no changes in the original repo that needs to be merged


lets say some one in the organization updated some files you should pull those changes before 
you send the next PR and if they changed the same files as you and if there are merge conflicts you should 
resolve them too because if they changed the same line as you that means you both edited the same line 
and that needs to be fixed by you i will show that in a bit BTW im edititing this as another member of the organization 
from this window 


example to show what happens when you commit without pulling. this commit is also from someone in the org(google)

this is the third change from the org


this will be your change
